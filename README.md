# Period Tracker

This project's purpose is to make a period tracker focused on privacy and safe data.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

To test in graphiql, go to [`localhost:4000/api`](http://localhost:4000/api)
